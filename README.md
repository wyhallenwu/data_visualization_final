# DATA VISUALIZATION FINAL
## Brief intro
This is the final project of the course data visualization and human computer interaction at Shanghai University. But  actually, I'm learning followed the course Principles and Techniques of Data Science, UCB fall 2021, the course homepage is https://ds100.org/fa21/ . And also, the course DA100 has its graduate projects. The detailed information is listed in https://ds100.org/fa21/grad_proj/gradproject/. There are also other useful materials I recommand such as https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners.  
I try to combine what I learn from these courses to make my own project practical and functional. If it can be exquisite that would great! haha :joy:  
Enjoy it! :joy:  
I try to write a doc for this project, however, I'm not native english speaker and weak in English writing. If you find somewhere confusing, I would appreciate it if you
point it out to me. Thank you for your correction!

## Analyze Purpose
Nowadays, more and more people are suffering from mental issues.
There are many rearchers focus on this topic. And in china, both government and society are concerning about mental health. So I believe it is worth diving into this study.  
**Challenge**: When I decide to choose this topic as my final project, the most basic and important challenge is that where I can get useful data. People may hard to share their real thoughts when directly talking about some private issues. So the reliability of the dataset is difficult to ensure. Fortunately, the biggest social media "**weibo**(in China)" has a special sharing accounts "ShuDong" where people can share their real thoughts anonymously. I also carefully check recent posts (nearly one-year data), and I believe most of information and sharings are highly credible. So I finally give up the topic I chose a week ago.(2022-01-10)  
In this project, I try to figure out several facts (including mentioned above).

## Ideas(need to check)
1. I may use jieba to do tokenization(nlp terminology)
2. I can analyze by year and find "word of each year"

## Environment and requirements
- all codes will be tested on Pycharm
- detailed requirements you can check requirements.txt which will released later

## Schedule

- [x] (2022-01-06): weibo spider
- [x] (2022-01-10)begin crawling data
- [ ] (2022-01-10)what to analyze?
