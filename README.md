# DATA VISUALIZATION FINAL
## Brief intro
This is the final project of the course data visualization and human computer interaction at Shanghai University. But  actually, I'm learning followed the course Principles and Techniques of Data Science, UCB fall 2021, the course homepage is https://ds100.org/fa21/ . And also, the course DA100 has its graduate projects. The detailed information is listed in https://ds100.org/fa21/grad_proj/gradproject/. There are also other useful materials I recommand such as https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners.  
I try to combine what I learn from these courses to make my own project practical and functional. If it can be exquisite that would great! haha :joy:  
Enjoy it! :joy:  
I try to write a doc for this project, however, I'm not native english speaker and weak in English writing. If you find somewhere confusing, I would appreciate it if you
point it out to me. Thank you for your correction!

## Analyze Purpose
Nowadays, there are millions of songs released every day. What is the real hit among these trends? 
And when I first think of this question, I find there are much more interesting points to study. For example,
what is the trend every year and does this change related to something else? Specifically, I remember rap is not so popular in my childhood, 
and people who like rap may be considered as a wack, but recent years more and more rap songs release and 
become a big hit? There are many other funny facts to be discovered.  
In this project, I try to figure out several facts (including mentioned above).
